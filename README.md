## Description

I created this application using MongoDB to serve as an API for a social network web app. This API creates a basic framework that can be used for a variety of social applications, where users can share content, react to other users' content, and create a friend list of other users. The process of creating this API allowed me to familiarize myself with  MongoDB and Mongoose. It also furthered my understanding of API structures, including models, routes and controllers. 

## Installation

In order to use the app, the user will need both Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose.
Installation instructions:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)
- [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [MongoDB](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb)
- [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)

## Usage

The user will invoke the application by typing node index.js into their command line. Once the server is live, the user can use various GET routes to view all users, a single user, all thoughts, or a single thought. They can use POST routes to create a new user, a new thought, a new reaction, or to add a user to another user's friend list. They can use PUT routes to update an existing user or thought. They can use DELETE routes to delete users, thoughts, reactions or friends.
